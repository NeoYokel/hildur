# Hildur Theme for Chrome

![Hildur Theme for Chrome](https://i.snap.as/Cgbt52e.png)

The Hildur Theme for Google Chrome is a light-colored, entirely simplistic color configuration extrapolated from a "brand" I created for my [experimental website](https://davidblue.wtf). Perhaps notably, it is the first piece of "software" I have ever personally "published," so you can now refer to me - that is, [David Blue](https://github.com/NeoYokel) - as a *software developer*.

## Colors

## Further Documentation

In glee in my new found Software Developer title, I have definitely gone overboard with documentation on this very simple... darn browser theme. The whole extent will be found [**on my personal wiki**](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Hildur-Google-Chrome-Theme-ffb7fd77a62e42c3a0b3b4c96d77e33e) (where you will also find every possible permeation and format of the color palette to download,) and just the appropriate stuff will be found in the [**Github repository**](https://github.com/NeoYokel/hildur), where I also intend to share a Firefox version, shortly.
